<!-- Pseudo-classes 
    - specify a special state of the selected element
    - select elements based on a state
    - select elements based on their position in the document

    :link

    The :link pseudo-class targets unvisited links â€“ or links that have not been clicked by the user. 
    For example, the CSS rule below selects all unvisited links on the page and sets their text color to orange:

    a:link {
        color: orange;
    }
 -->


<!-- 
    :visited
    
    By default, most browsers set the color of visited links to purple. You can use the :visited pseudo-class to target links that have been visited (or clicked). 
    This rule selects all visited links on the page and applies a new color and border-bottom styles.

    a:visited {
        color: lightblue;
        border-bottom: 1px dashed;
    }

<!-- 

    :first-child

    The :first-child pseudo-class targets the first element among a group of sibling elements. 
    For example, the following will select only the list element that is the first child of its parent:

    li:first-child {
        background: #52bab3;
        color: white;
    }

  -->

<!-- 

    :last-child
    
    The :last-child pseudo-class targets the last child of its parent.

    li:last-child {
         border-bottom: none;
    }

    The selector shown above matches only the <li> in a list and removes a border-bottom style. 
    It doesn't matter how many list items you add or remove from the list, the last item will always be the one selected.

    :nth-child

    The :nth-child() pseudo-class targets elements based on their position within a parent element. :nth-child() uses a function-like syntax that accepts a value between the parentheses. 
    The value is referred to as an argument.

    -- Select Even Elements Within a Parent --
    The keyword even specifies that you want to target all the even-numbered elements.     
    For example, the selector li:nth-child(even) matches the 2nd, 4th, 6th (etc.) <li> elements within a <ul>:
    
    li:nth-child(even) {
        color: white;
        background-color: springgreen;
    }

    -- Select Odd Elements Within a Parent --
    The keyword odd specifies that you want to target all the odd-numbered elements. The following selector matches the 1st, 3rd, 5th (etc.) <li> elements within a <ul>:
    
    li:nth-child(odd) {
        color: white;
        background-color: turquoise;
    }

    -- Passing a Number to Target a Child Element --
    You can also pass an integer as an argument to target a specific child element. 
    When calculating the position of an element inside its parent, the index numbering starts at 1.

    li:nth-child(3) {
        color: white;
        background-color: thistle;
    } 

    The browser targets only the 3rd list item inside the parent <ul>.
