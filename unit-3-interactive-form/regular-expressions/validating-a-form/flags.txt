Flags
- let you change what a regex matches in some way

i = Case-insensitive, makes the regex case insensitive

g = Global, makes the regex match globally

m = Multiline

/regex/igm - add after last slash of a regex literal, can be in any order

'LION'.replace(/lion/i, 'mouse'); // replaces mouse with lion, because regex says find any string with lion, lower or uppercase

'LION'.replace(/[a-z]+/i, 'mouse'); // does the same as above


'She ate watermelon at the waterpark.'.replace(/water/, ''); // would replace the first instance of water, not the second

'She ate watermelon at the waterpark.'.replace(/water/g, ''); // would replace all instances of water, as we've used the g flag

const treat = `cheese
                cheese
                cheese`;
treat.replace(/^cheese$/, 'fruit'); // wouldn't match any, as it's multiline
treat.replace(/^cheese$/m, 'fruit'); // would match the first one
treat.replace(/^cheese$/mg, 'fruit'); // would match all of them, as it's multiline and global
