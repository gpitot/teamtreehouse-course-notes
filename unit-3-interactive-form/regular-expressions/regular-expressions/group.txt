(sub){2} = matches "subsub"

(sub)?pat = matches "pat" and "subpat"

Example One
regex = (toy|sail|tug) boat
matches
    toy boat
    sail boat
    tug boat

Example Two
regex = google\.(com|net|org)

using \ escapes the stops normal behaviour in regex, which is to match any character, instead the parser interprets it as a literal character

This is useful to avoid bugs, as . would match google$com or google-com

matches = 
    google.com
    google.net
    google.org
