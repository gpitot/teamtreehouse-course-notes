Regex, or regular expressions, are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.

They are often used to validate correct inputs on the web e.g. when searching for a word on a page, or entering a form

The ? is used to make the character to the left optional 
    - e.g. toyboats? would find anything on a page <toyboat> or <toyboats>
    - e.g. toyboa?ts would find toybot, toyboats
    - e.g. toy ?boats would find even if the user had made two words toy boats    

    - ? matches 0 or 1 character, aka the character is optional 
        e.g. colou?r will match color or colour

The [] is used to say either character is accepted
    - e.g. [Ttj]oyboats would find both upper and lowercase spellings and the word <joyboats>

[TTj]oy[ -]?[Bb]oats?
